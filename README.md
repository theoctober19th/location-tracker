# React Native Blog App
I built this application as part of the [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/) of React Native. It allows you to keep tracks of the paths you followed in real life and allows you to save them in your device.

For me, the purpose of making this application were to learn:
- Google Maps SDK for Android and iOS
- Google Sign-In API
- Facebook SDK Auth API
- Geolocation in Android and iOS

The app needs a lot modifications to run off-the-box in your device. Some of the modifications needed are:
- Change API keys of Google Maps API
- Create your own Google Project
- Create your own Firebase Project
- Create your own Facebook app
- Modify to include your own Facebook App ID, etc.

Happy Learning! ðŸ¤“
